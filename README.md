# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

This is a collaborative filtering-based **Movie Recommender System** built using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). It predicts and recommends movies to users based on their past ratings and the preferences of similar users.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Built using user-based collaborative filtering
- âœ… Calculates user similarity using cosine similarity
- âœ… Recommends top-rated movies that similar users have liked
- âœ… Clean and modular code in Jupyter Notebook
- âœ… Easy to extend with Streamlit for a simple UI (future plan)

## ðŸ§  How It Works

This recommender system uses the concept of **collaborative filtering**. It assumes:
> *"Users who agreed in the past will agree in the future."*

### Steps:
1. Load movie and rating data
2. Merge them into a user-movie matrix
3. Calculate similarity between users using cosine similarity
4. Recommend movies liked by similar users that the current user hasnâ€™t watched yet
